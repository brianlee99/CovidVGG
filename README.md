# CovidVGG
## About
This project was created as the final project of CMPT340 - our biomedical computing course at Simon Fraser University. 

## Usage
We have run the code on Google Colaboratory, since it has a decent GPU even in its free tier. However, if you have a GPU, you are free to run this code on your local machine instead.
